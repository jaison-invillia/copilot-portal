# Full Feature Cycle Skill

End-to-end workflow for delivering a complete feature, from initial demand to merged, documented PR.

## When to Use

- Delivering a complete feature end-to-end
- Running the full agent pipeline for a single feature
- Ensuring nothing is missed in the development lifecycle

## Procedure

### Phase 1 — Triage (PO + Architect)

1. Invoke `product-owner` agent with the feature demand
   - Produces a tracker-card draft with acceptance criteria, priority, and subtasks
   - Waits for explicit approval before any tracker write
2. If approved and writable MCP support exists, invoke `architect` agent with the created card/issue number
   - Posts architectural analysis and file structure
   - Identifies if ADR is needed
3. If DB impact exists, invoke `dba` agent with the same issue number
   - Posts database analysis (schema/migrations/constraints/indexes/risks)
   - Requests documentation updates through `documenter` when needed
4. If no writable MCP support exists, stop in draft-only mode and ask for manual card creation before continuing the full cycle

### Phase 2 — Implementation (Staff + BE/FE)

5. Invoke `staff` agent with the issue number
   - Clarifies ambiguities and validates task quality
   - Triggers `documenter` for mandatory mini documentation plan
   - Consults `dba` when database impact exists (before backend delegation)
   - Classifies testing approach as `feature_nova` or `mudanca_existente`
   - Plans implementation at code level
   - Consults `test-advisor` for testing strategy by classification
   - Delegates to `backend-dev` and/or `frontend-dev`
   - Parallelizes independent delegations whenever possible
   - Sub-agents implement code and tests
   - Staff validates and opens PR

### Phase 3 — Quality (QA + Reviewer)

4. Invoke `qa` agent with the issue/PR number
   - Runs automated tests
   - Validates acceptance criteria
   - Posts QA report

5. Invoke `reviewer` agent with the PR number
   - Only when there are code changes
   - Reviews code against all guidelines
   - Posts review with approve/request changes

### Phase 4 — Documentation (Documenter)

6. Invoke `documenter` at task start (mini-plan) and again after implementation with PR number
   - Start: classify doc impact (`required`/`optional`/`none`)
   - Updates affected documentation
   - Creates ADR if architectural decisions were made
   - Updates CONTEXT_PACK if significant

### Phase 5 — Metrics (Metrifier — optional)

7. Optionally invoke `metrifier` for observability recommendations
   - Suggests metrics to collect
   - Recommends instrumentation approach

## Completion Checklist

Refer to the [full checklist](./references/checklist.md) for the Definition of Done.

## Important Notes

- Each phase depends on the previous one completing successfully
- If any phase fails or is blocked, resolve before proceeding
- The approved tracker card should be updated by each agent throughout
- The product-owner must always show the draft and wait for explicit approval before creating or updating any tracker card
- All work must respect project documentation as source of truth
